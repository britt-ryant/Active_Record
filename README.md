# Active_Record
Ruby slips for Active Record

Active Record is the interface that Rails gives you between the database and your application. 
It is the Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) layer supplied with Rails.
So:
-tables map to classes,
-rows map to objects and
-columns map to object attributes.

Active Record takes data which is stored in a database table using rows and columns, 
which needs to be modified or retrieved by writing SQL statements 
(if youâ€™re using a SQL database), 
and it lets you interact with that data as though it was a normal Ruby object.

Each Active Record object has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) methods for database access. 
This strategy allows simple designs and straight forward mappings between database tables and application objects.
